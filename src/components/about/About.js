        Model People is a home recording project by Ryan Walker. Hello, I'm
        going to talk in the first person now. These are songs (right now, song)
        that I have been sitting on for a while. These songs will probably never
        be more than home demos that I like and am open to sharing with other
        people. It's also given me a reason to put them up on this really nice
        webpage that I made from scratch. I have been doing that more often and
        have more examples of that work on{' '}

        Most of these songs are short and a little rough, but that's what I kind
        of like about them. They are simple thoughts written down, sung, and
        played with an electric guitar. I like the sounds I was able to make
        with just a minimal setup. An amp, one USB mic, a guitar, and a bass
        were all that I used. Sometime I didn't even use a real bass.
        <CringeFace /> I recorded in Logic and programmed drums, synths, and
        sometimes bass <CringeFace />
        through the interface. And that's the secret. Bookmark this blog post if
        you really want to make bad recordings.
